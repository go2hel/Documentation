title: "PowerShell for Linux Users"

## Welcome to the Guide

This documentation is a practical, quick-reference guide designed for users who are already familiar with the Linux command line and want to learn the PowerShell equivalents. While many commands have simple aliases that are identical to their Linux counterparts (`ls`, `cp`, `mv`), the underlying philosophy and power of PowerShell come from its object-oriented nature.

## The Core Idea: Objects, Not Text

The most important shift to make when moving from Bash to PowerShell is that commands (called "cmdlets") return **structured objects**, not just strings of text. This allows you to pipe data between commands in a much more powerful and reliable way, without needing text-parsing tools like `awk` or `sed` for many common tasks.

This guide is organized into sections that mirror common command-line tasks. Use the menu to navigate through categories like **Navigation**, **File Management**, **Searching**, and more advanced **Object Utilities**.
