This section covers the fundamental mechanics of the PowerShell environment itself. Moving beyond direct command-for-command equivalents, these topics explain *how* the shell works and provide you with the tools for discovery and advanced command composition.

Mastering these concepts is the key to moving from simple interactive commands to writing powerful, one-line solutions and automation scripts. We will cover:

- **The Help System**: How to get help on any command (`Get-Help`).
- **The Pipeline**: Understanding how objects flow between commands.
- **Redirection**: How to control the input and output of commands.
