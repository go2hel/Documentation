This section covers the fundamental PowerShell commands for managing the lifecycle of files and directories. These are the direct equivalents of common Linux commands like `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, and `mv`.

The cmdlets used for these tasks are `New-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `Copy-Item`, and `Move-Item`. A key concept you will see throughout this section is the consistent use of parameters like **`-Recurse`** to act on directories and their contents, and **`-Force`** to suppress confirmation prompts. Mastering these commands is essential for both interactive shell use and automation scripts.
